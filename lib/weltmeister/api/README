INFO
================================================================================
ImpactJS is a kick-ass JavaScript/HTMl5 game entine that uses the <canvas>
element and underlying drawing api. It unfortunately depends on the developer
having Apache/PHP installed on their machine to use the built-in level editor
(Weltmeister).

If you're running Windows and doing HTML5 game development, you most likely
already have IIS (and the .NET framework) installed. The files in this package
allow you to run ImpactJS and the Weltmeister editor in IIS, eliminating the need
to download, install and configure apache and PHP.



PRE-REQUISITES
================================================================================
For the files in this package to work successfully, it is assumed that you have
the following already installed on your computer:

- A Windows machine (XP, Vista, 7, Server 2003 or Server 2008)
- .NET Framework 2.0 or greater
- IIS and ASP.NET (can be installed via Microsoft's Web Platform installer: )



INSTALLATION
================================================================================
- Unpack the ImpactJS engine files to your IIS web directory
  (usualy c:\inetpub\wwwroot)

- Copy the files in this package to the /lib/weltmeister/api folder of the
  ImpactJS installation

- Make the following changes to /lib/weltmeister/api/web.config:
  - Set the "rootFile" key to the path in your IIS installation where this
    instance of ImpactJS is located. If the installation is at the root of the
    IIS website, leave the value at its default: "/". If, for example, you have
    Impact installed in the /impact folder in your IIS root, just change the
    web.config key to read "/impact". Simple as that!

- Make the following changes to /lib/weltmeister/config.js:
  - change the 'save' value in the 'api' section to: 'lib/weltmeister/api/save.aspx' (line 55)
  - change the 'browse' value in the 'api' section to: 'lib/weltmeister/api/browse.aspx' (line 56)
  - change the 'glob' value in the 'api' section to: 'lib/weltmeister/api/glob.aspx' (line 57)

- Make the following change to /lib/weltmeister/modal-dialog.js:
  - change the 'this.pathDropdown' value to: 'lib/weltmeister/api/browse.aspx' in the initDialog function (line 96)

- Browse to /weltmeister.html in your website and ensure that everything loaded
  and no exceptions were thrown (check the JavaScript error console in your
  browser).

Once you follow these steps, you should be able to work with ImpactJS in IIS
just as you would if you were running Apache/PHP.
